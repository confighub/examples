# ConfigHub Examples

This repo contains examples that demonstrate how ConfigHub works in various scenarios. ConfigHub is still in a private preview and this repo will not be very useful to you if you are not part of the preview. But feel free to look around.

## How to use this repo

Clone this repo to your local machine and make sure you have `cub` installed and that you are logged in. Each example is contained in its own directory. To try out an example, `cd` into the directory and follow the instructions in the README.

Some examples will include running a local Kind Kubernetes cluster on your machine so it is a good idea to have Kind installed as well.

## General structure and script behavior

Scripts and commands in this repo are designed to not interfere with other resources already in your organization. **BUT run them at your own risk**. You should check the contents of scripts before executing them. This will help you understand how the CLI commands work and can also prevent any unforseen accidents.

Scripts are usually located in a `bin` directory in the example dir and are executed from the example root, e.g. `bin/cleanup`. There are usually at least an `install` script and a `cleanup` script.

## Examples

* [Global App](global-app/README.md) - demonstrates how to use ConfigHub to manage a typical micro-service application deployed in different variants for testing, staging, and production across multiple regions
* [Helm Platform Components](helm-platform-components/README.md) - demonstrates how to render Helm charts into ConfigHub and customize the config inside ConfigHub
